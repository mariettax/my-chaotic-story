My Chaotic Story: Life's Ledger - The Hectic Day Sim
Welcome to the Beautiful Chaos!
This repository hosts "My Chaotic Story: Life's Ledger - The Hectic Day Sim," a browser-based life simulation game where players navigate the unpredictable chaos of modern daily life, making choices that impact their resources and well-being. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is a testament to the dynamic interplay between strategic product management, creative game design, and iterative AI-powered development.

About the Game
"My Chaotic Story" plunges you into the delightful pandemonium of everyday existence, specifically set in the city of London, Ontario. It's not just about surviving; it's about thriving (or at least, trying to!) amidst a constant stream of decisions and unexpected events.

Core Gameplay & Resources: The Balancing Act
At its heart, the game is a resource management challenge. You'll constantly juggle:

Energy üîã: Your physical fuel. Depletes with activity, recovers (mostly) with rest. Hit zero? Day's over, champ!

Money üí∞: The universal solvent. Earn it, spend it, try not to lose it all.

Stress ü§Ø: The silent antagonist. Builds up with challenges, eases (hopefully) with self-care. Keep it in check!

Kid Happiness üòä / Subscribers ‚ñ∂Ô∏è: Your primary "success" metric, depending on your chosen life path. For parents, it's the joy of your little ones. For the aspiring YouTuber, it's the fickle nature of your audience.

Social Life ü§ù: Your connections to the world. Nurture them for support, neglect them at your peril.

Mood üòêüòÑüò©üí°ü§Ø: Your emotional state, dynamically influencing how tasks affect your other resources. A happy mood might make tasks easier, while a stressed one makes everything harder.

Diverse Life Paths: Who Will You Be?
A key feature of "My Chaotic Story" is the ability to choose distinct player archetypes, each offering a unique set of challenges and experiences:

Entry-Level Retail Associate: Experience the grind of customer service, shift work, and tight budgets.

International Student (Western University): Balance demanding academics with job hunting, immigration complexities, and navigating a new city.

Construction Worker: Face the physical demands of the job, long hours, and the rewards of hard, honest work.

YouTuber (Roblox Gamer): A personal favorite, inspired by my son's love for gaming! Dive into the world of content creation, video editing, audience engagement, and the quest for viral fame (and monetization).

Embracing the Chaos: Dynamic Features
To make the game truly "hectic and fun," we've integrated several dynamic systems:

Dynamic Moods: Your emotional state isn't just a display; it actively impacts your resource gains and losses, adding a psychological layer to your daily decisions.

Whims & Opportunities ‚ú®: Inspired by Sims-like "whims," these are spontaneous, short-term mini-quests (like "Grab a Coffee" or "Watch a Funny Video") that offer quick boosts or minor penalties if ignored.

Relationship Dynamics: Your "Social Life" meter encourages you to maintain connections, offering benefits when nurtured and consequences when neglected.

Home & Environment Challenges: Unexpected real-world problems like a "Leaky Faucet" or "Internet Outage" can pop up, adding unforeseen costs and stress.

Bills & Subscriptions üí∏: Regular bills (rent, utilities, internet) with hard deadlines add a crucial financial pressure point. Missing them? Prepare for increased stress and late fees!

Investment/Gambling Mini-Games: Feeling lucky? A "Buy a Lottery Ticket" whim offers a small chance at a big payout, adding a touch of unpredictable excitement.

Kid/Subscriber Repercussions: Neglecting your primary "success" metric has consequences! Unhappy kids or plummeting subscriber counts can lead to increased stress and other negative events.

Hard Deadlines: Critical tasks, like paying rent, come with strict deadlines, forcing strategic prioritization.

Visualizing the Hectic: Task Animations
Initially, completing a task would simply show a message. To enhance player engagement and provide satisfying feedback, we implemented a dynamic animation system. Now, when you click "Do Task," a full-screen overlay appears with a thematic emoji and a short, playful animation, bringing your actions to life!

How to Play
Start Your Story: Choose your name, family size, and starting job.

Manage Your Day: The game runs on a 24-hour clock. Select tasks from your "Today's Tasks" list. Each task consumes time and affects your Energy, Money, Stress, and other resources.

React to Life: Be prepared for "Whims" and "Emergency Meetings!" These unexpected events will pop up, requiring quick decisions.

End of Day: Your day concludes at 10:00 PM, when you run out of Energy, or when all main tasks are done.

Review & Reset: Check your "Daily Report" to see how you fared, then click "Next Day" to continue your chaotic journey!

The Development Journey: An AI-Powered Collaboration
This project showcases a modern, iterative development workflow, highlighting my role as a Creator, Strategic Product Manager, Technical Writer, and AI Prompt Engineer.

The process unfolded as a dynamic partnership with a large language model (LLM):

The Genesis (Initial Prompt): It all began with a foundational prompt to an AI: "Create a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript game that simulates daily life challenges. The player should manage resources like energy, money, and stress, by completing tasks. Include a day-night cycle and a basic end-of-day summary." This established the core mechanics.

Multi-AI Synergy (Code Integration): A unique strategic decision involved leveraging another Gemini AI chatbot for specialized code generation. When the need for more engaging visual feedback for task completion arose, I specifically prompted a separate AI for HTML/CSS/JS animation code. I then acted as the "integration manager," feeding that refined code back into this primary development conversation. This demonstrates an advanced approach to AI orchestration.

Iterative Refinement & Feature Explosion: From that point, the game evolved through continuous iteration, driven by my prompts and the AI's development capabilities:

Player Archetypes: Moving beyond a generic player to introduce distinct job roles like Retail, International Student, and Construction Worker. The YouTuber (Roblox Gamer) role was a delightful, personal addition, directly inspired by my son's request ‚Äì a true example of incorporating user feedback!

Enhanced Visuals: Implementing the dynamic task animations to transform simple messages into engaging visual feedback.

Adding "Hectic" Layers: Introducing complex systems like dynamic moods, spontaneous whims, a "Social Life" resource, unpredictable home challenges, recurring bills with hard deadlines, and the crucial "Kid/Subscriber Repercussions" for neglected resources.

Debugging & Quality Assurance: My role as a technical writer and product manager was critical in identifying errors (like the TypeError related to uncompleted whims), providing precise error messages, and guiding the AI to implement robust fixes. This human-AI feedback loop was essential for stability and quality.

This project exemplifies how an AI Prompt Engineer can effectively lead and manage an AI development team, translating high-level product visions into functional, engaging experiences through clear communication, strategic prompting, and meticulous quality control.
